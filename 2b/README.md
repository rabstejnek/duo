# Project 2b for CSC 417 - Theory of Programming Languages.

Implementing Monte Carlo filter in Java.

## Installing

Run the 'install' executable to set up a Java and Python environment.

## Executing

Within the 2b folder execute 'run'. A 'run.out' file should be populated with output from the old Monte Carlo script and our new Monte Carlo script.

**Note:** The original script outputs Python dictionaries instead of a CSV file, so we set up our script to print out the results in the same format. The key / value pairs in the dictionary do not have to be in the same order, since Python dictionaries are unordered.
